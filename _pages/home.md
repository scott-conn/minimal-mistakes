# <center> Welcome to my homepage!</center> 
I am a graduate student at Caltech working with <a href=" https://jcallies.com/">JÃ¶rn Callies</a> and <a href=" https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/">Andy Thompson</a> on wave-eddy interactions and Southern Ocean dynamics. I received my Master of Physics (MPhys) in theoretical physics from the University of Edinburgh in 2020. I am especially interested in using theoretical tools to make sense of ocean observations. I also use idealised and process-based models to isolate the underlying physics of the ocean.
