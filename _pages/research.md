## Near-Inertial Wave Dynmics 
<p align="justify">
I am interested in the dynamics of near-inertial waves (NIWs) with a focus on understanding how their evolution is influenced by ocean turbulence. Near-inertial waves are ubiquotous in the ocean. They are forced by passing atmospheric storms and have a frequency close to the local coriolis frequency. Despite NIWs often being regarded as a contaminant in observations, they exhibit rich dynamics than influences the climate system. Perhaps their most important role is in upper ocean mixing. Through a strong vertical shear, NIWs can induce mixing and deepening of the surface mixed layer. 

The dynamics of NIWs may be strongly modulated by the mesoscale eddy field. My thesis has focused on understanding this interaction in observations. I have used theoretical models of the NIW-mesoscale interactions to understand observations and quantify the role of various physical processes in the observed evolution of NIWs. I have also worked on understanding how the signature of NIW-mesoscale interactions may vary spatially in the ocean and how this may explain variations in the observed impact of the mesoscale eddy field on NIW evolution. The remainder of my thesis will try to extend theory of NIW-turbulence interactions to include submesoscale features as well as trying to observe this interaction in observations.

    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 14px; color: #555;">This animation shows simulations of the NIW-mesoscale interaction. The surface shows the mesoscale vorticity and the depth shows the wave activity (for NIWs this is proportional to the wave kinetic energy). There is rapid concentration of NIWs into anticyclones where they can propagate to depth.</p>
