## Near-Inertial Wave Dynmics 
<p align="justify">
I am interested in the dynamics of near-inertial waves (NIWs) with a focus on understanding how their evolution is influenced by ocean turbulence. Near-inertial waves are ubiquotous in the ocean. They are forced by passing atmospheric storms and have a frequency close to the local coriolis frequency. Despite NIWs often being regarded as a contaminant in observations, they exhibit rich dynamics than influences the climate system. Perhaps their most important role is in upper ocean mixing. Through a strong vertical shear, NIWs can induce mixing and deepening of the surface mixed layer. At many latitudes, NIWs have a similar frequency to the $M_2$ tidal peak. Unlike tides, however, the leading order NIW pressure perturbation is zero and so traditional satellite altimetry is blind to NIWs. This makes observing NIWs limited to *in-situ* observations. There is still much we don't understand about the life cycle of wind-generated NIWs.

As NIWs propagate in the ocean, they interact with the mesoscale eddy field. This is known to significantly affect the evolution of NIWs. My research has focused on understanding how to observe this interaction.
